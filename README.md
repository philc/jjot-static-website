This is a online sticky notes software I built with David Renie in 2007. It's hosted at
[jjot.com](https://www.jjot.com).

**Why is this important to me? (May 30 2020)**

I submitted this to YCombinator in the summer of 2007, a year after graduating college. I built it with
@dmrenie, my college classmate who worked for Google. We got an onsite interview with YCombinator but they
ultimately did not invest. Reflecting back, they were right not to: we didn't know what users wanted. Jjot was
a polished note taking tool which I created for an unvalidated use case.

This project is special to me because I worked so hard on it and it represented the cutting edge of client
side development. In particular, the rich text editor used in the notes was very advanced for the time,
especially considering how it overcame complex DOM interactions resulting from other UI features of the site
(drag and drop, note resizing). For some reason I made it a point to make this work seamlessly across all
browsers, including IE6, which was a major undertaking and added significant complexity to the development. In
retrospect, I should've not bothered with IE6 before validating that this app was even useful.

Jjot was a product of its time: a snappy and polished client-side app as Web 2.0 apps were exploding in number
and sophistication. It was a pleasure to make such a thick client, because the user experience really was
great compared to the average site. In fact, I developed this from a country house in a remote location in
Maryland, and we only had satellite internet service available. Using websites over Satellite internet is
really terrible due to the high latency. As a necessity, really, I made sure Jjot had a great user experience
even when the connection is slow and unreliable, by handling all interactions on the client and saving state
in the background periodically.

It's amazing to me that its UI and most of its features still work great in today's browsers.
