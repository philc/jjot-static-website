Javascripts
===========

Common javascript files

They're not copied to the public/javascripts folder because then you wouldn't receive
updates. Instead, you can serve them up from a javascripts controller which is installed
when you install the plugin.

Add this to your routes.rb file after installing:
map.connect '/javascripts/*jsfile', :controller => 'javascripts'
